Well this is no doubt my best effort for a blog title yet.

You might think this is going to be the greatest
[shaggy dog story yet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaggy_dog_story)
but hang with me, I reckon it will work.

Anyway, the other day I was giving a lecture to my second year Phys Chem
students on the hydrogen-like atomic orbitals (as you do). I can’t remember if
it was because the projector failed or what, but I for some reason I felt like
winging it. I guess I felt like explaining the shapes of the atomic orbitals by
reference to something *real* -- because the way they do it in textbooks is just
so darned *abstract*.

At this point I remembered the old
[Chladni figures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Chladni#Chladni_figures).

I think I even made them once with my old electronics set.

Anyway, the students had no idea what I was talking about -- so off I went.

## Chladni figures

You see, the shapes of the atomic orbitals are not all that strange.

You can see essentially the same kind of shapes when you sprinkle sand on a
vibrating plate. A bloke called
[Ernst Chladni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Chladni) (1756-1827) first
made them by using a violin bow to make a metal plate vibrate, hence the name.

Below you can see some of the complicated vibrating-sand patterns you can get
on a circular plate. They sure are [purrty](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Purrty).
If you want to see them actually appearing look
[here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf0t4qIVWF4).

## Deja vu

You might not believe it, but you have seen this stuff before.

Let’s take a step back and look at some *simpler* Chlandi figures:

<figure>
   <img src="/images/chladni-figure-circular-plate-simple.jpg">
</figure>

If you squint a bit, you will see that these vibrating patterns are
actually quite similar to the atomic orbitals!

* The first column corresponds to the s-type orbitals. They are all spherical
  (well, actually circular) in shape.

* The next column has a node through the middle -- just like the p orbitals.
  As we we go down the column we get extra circular nodes.

* Likewise the third column has *two* nodes through the middle, as well
  as an increasing numbe of circular nodes -- very much like the
  3d, 4d, 5d atomic orbitals.

If you are a bit skeptical about all this, look at this web page
at wikipedia which shows
[simulated animations of these figures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrations_of_a_circular_membrane#Animations_of_several_vibration_modes). These are images of a vibrating drum.
Cool, huh? In these figures the s, p, d orbitals go across the page (1s, 2s,
3s; 2p, 3p, 4p; 3d, 4d, 4d). Immediately below the 1s “orbital” you can see the
p orbitals. **This is so important for understanding that the
alleged 2p orbital is reproduced below for further analysis**.

<figure>
   <img src="/images/chladni-figure-circular-plate-2p.gif">
</figure>

See the two “lobes” which vibrate up and down like a see-saw?

These are just like the lobes of the 2p atomic orbital!

This explains why you sometimes see one lobe marked with the + (plus)
sign and the other markedwith the - (minus) sign. The signs have *nothing* to
do with electric charge. Rather, they explain that the two lobes
are vibrating *out of phase* --- like a see saw.

This is really important!

Because: to get a strong chemical bond the waves from two different
orbitals on two different atoms --- they can be p orbitals or not ---
need to add up *in phase* . If not, there will be a net cancellation and the
sum of the two vibrating orbitals will disappear. No vibration means no
chemical bond. Make sense? This is what it means for two orbitals to
“overlap” properly to form a chemical bond.

I want to make this absolutely clear: you should think of 2p electrons
vibrating in an atom just like the above picture. Think of a 2p electron as
actually *being* this pulsating atomic orbital. It’s a great model!

## The pulsating 1s-orbital jellyfish

Of course, in reality the electron is *not* a drum membrane. It is made of ...
electron stuff.

More important, the electron inhabits three dimensional space
(actually four, if you count spin, but that is another story) not two
dimensions like a drum head.

So in reality our 2p electron --- in fact *any* electron --- is a
pulsating 3D object.

I guess the closest you can get to an object like this is ... a
jellyfish! I imagine the jellyfish is a good model for the s-type atomic
orbitals.

## Faraday’s waves

Of course, looking at sand on vibrating plates or drums is not the only
way to visualize sound. (You might be surprised that there is actually a word
for visualizing sound: it is called [cymatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymatics)).

The next candidate that comes to mind is the old corn starch liquid --- you
know, that gloopy white stuff that you made as a kid, a
[non-Newtonian fluid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Newtonian_fluid),
that gets harder when you hit it.

Now the things is: with Chladni figures what we are seeing is all about the
vibrating plate or drum skin. On the other hand, vibrations of gloopy
corn-starch materials is more about the properties of those materials
themselves.

The wave shapes that appear in such materials are much more bizzare.

If the frequency of vibration is high enough, we can often see
“standing waves”. Such standing waves were described by
[Michael Faraday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday) (1791-1867)
and so are sometimes called [Faraday waves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_wave)
or more generally, [oscillons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillon)
or [solitons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton).

Even more exotic, it is possible to generate “holes” in vibrating cornstarch
that don’t disappear! These holes have interesting properties: they repel each
other and sometimes form “bonded pairs”. At still higher frequency unstable
“forests of gloop” -- for want of a better description -- start to “grow”. All
this is too strange for words. Seeing is believing; check out the video below.

## Gloop and the de Broglie-Bohm theory

Remarkably, there is *another* connection between quantum mechanics and the
gloopy viscous fluid which behaves strangely when vibrated.

Pay attention now.

Aficionados of quantum theory will know that it is a doubly dual theory.
Not only is it a theory of
[wave-particle duality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality),
but it is simultaneously one of the best and worst theories ever conceived!

* It is one of the *best* theories because the precision and accuracy of its
  predictions are unsurpassed

* It is one of the *worst* theories because, being a statistical theory, it
  doesn’t actually explain *why* it works. Consequently, there are a plethora
  of different [interpretations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics),
  of what it means. These interpretations range from the standard
  [Copenhagen one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation)
  to the outlandish
  [Parallel Universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) viewpoint.

The [de Broglie-Bohm (dBB) interpretation of quantum
mechanics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie%E2%80%93Bohm_theory) was one
of the first which proved that it was even *possible* to have an alternative
interpretation which was logically consistent. Unlike the standard interpretation,
the dBB viewpoint asserts that there is an *actual particle* in quantum
mechanics; yet it still manages to make exactly the same predictions
as the regular interpretation.

The idea behind he dBB theory is almost trivial: it is that the actual particle
moves according to a nonlocal potential which is related to the
wavefunction. This is why the theory is also called the 
[pilot wave theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_wave).
The wavefunction itself still obeys the Schrodinger equation. The “random”
results that are obtained in quantum experiments --- for example the
famous [double slit experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#Interference_of_individual_particles)
where a diffraction pattern is “built up” one particle at a time on the
detector screen --- are controlled by variations in the initial conditions of
the particle.

(Lest you think the dBB theory is a somewhat useless, since anyway we have to
solve the Schrodinger equation to use it, you should know that it is the basis
of a very practical scheme for modelling chemical reactions, developed by
[Bob Wyatt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Wyatt).
See [here](http://k2.chem.uh.edu/group/OldStuff/Papers/JCP-WB.pdf).)

**But what has all this to do with viscous vibrating gloop?**

Prepare to be amazed.

In the following video,
[Yves Coudert](http://www.msc.univ-paris-diderot.fr/spip.php?rubrique140) shows
how a droplet suspended on a fast vibrating fluid, in this case silicone oil
behaves almost identically to how one would expect in the dBB theory. In
particular, Coudert demonstrates how one droplet --- representing an electron
for example --- can move through a double slit and generate, one particle at a
time, a diffraction pattern! By contrast, in the standard interpretation of
quantum mechanics, the electron is supposed to go through *both* slits at once
and diffract with itself. After looking at this video you might change your mind about
the dBB interpretation.
