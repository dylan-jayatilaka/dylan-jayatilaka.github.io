The Pauli principle states that the wavefunction for a group of identical
fermion particles (e.g electrons) must change sign when any two of the
particles coordinates are swapped,

$$
 \Psi(\textbf{x}_1 \ldots
      \textbf{x}_i \ldots
      \textbf{x}_j \ldots
      \textbf{x}_\textrm{N})
=
-\Psi(\textbf{x}_1 \ldots
      \textbf{x}_j \ldots
      \textbf{x}_i \ldots
      \textbf{x}_\textrm{N})
$$

Now the simplest wavefunction we can think of is Hartree's orbital-product
wavefunction

$$
\Phi(\textbf{x}_1 \ldots 
     \textbf{x}_\textrm{N})
=
\phi_1(\textbf{x}_1) \ldots 
\phi_\textrm{N}(\textbf{x}_\textrm{N})
$$

Think of this as wavefunction representing electron 1 in orbital 
\\( \phi_1 \\), electron 2 in orbital \\( \phi_2 \\), and so on 
for all \\( N \\) particles. 
Note: if we swap coordinates \\( \textbf{x}_i \\) and 
\\( \textbf{x}_j \\) in the above product, it is the same as leaving the 
coordinates unchanged but swapping the functions \\( \phi_i \\) and 
\\( \phi_j \\). So we see that after the swap we we will not have the same
wavefunction --- the electrons will be in different orbitals. So the
wavefunction is not the same --- let alone obey the Pauli principle where
the wavefunction is supposed to be the same except for sign reversal.

How can we make a wavefunction which satisfies the Pauli principle?

Let's make the problem a bit easier. Suppose we wanted a wavefunction
where swapping electrons led to *no* change. How to achieve that?

One way is to take any wavefunction, permute the particle coordinates in all
ways, then add all these permuted-coordinate wavefunctions together. We call
this a **symmetrized wavefunction** because if we swap any pair of coordinates
in this sum it will remain unchanged. It remains the same because in the list
of all permuted wavefunctions a particular term always occurs with a unique
partner where the two coordinates are swapped. We write the symmetriized
wavefunction like this:

$$
\Phi(\B{x}_1\ldots\B{x}_{N}) 
=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_e!}}
\sum_u^{N!} P_u 
\phi_1(\textbf{x}_1) \ldots
\phi_\textrm{N}(\textbf{x}_{N}).
$$

Incidentally, such a wavefunction is appropriate to describe a *boson*
wavefunction which obeys the Pauli principle for bosons. But we are 
interested in electrons, which are fermions, so the wavefunction should
change sign. Since the permuted list contains all terms in pairs, it
should be clear to you that for the wavefunction to change sign every
term must be *subtracted* from its permuted partner if we want the
wavefunction to change sign. The result is

$$
\Phi(\B{x}_1\ldots\B{x}_{N}) 
=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_e!}}
\sum_u^{N!} \sigma_u P_u 
\phi_1(\textbf{x}_1) \ldots
\phi_\textrm{N}(\textbf{x}_{N}).
$$

The \\( \sigma_u \\) is either +1 or -1 depending on whether
the permutation \\( P_u \\) if even or odd. The whole wavefunction
is **antisymmetrized**.

Note that *any* wavefunction can be symmetrized or antisymmetrized,
not just the Hartree orbital-product wavefunction, as we have done.

Finally, the antisymmetrized orbital-product wavefunction can be written 
in terms of a determinant like this

$$
\Psi(\textbf{x}_1\ldots\textbf{x}_{N})
=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}
\textrm{det}\,
\left|
\begin{array}{lll}
\phi_1(\textrm{x}_1)          & \ldots & \phi_1(\B{x}_\textrm{N}) \\
\vdots                        & \ddots & \vdots                   \\
\phi_\textrm{N}(\textrm{x}_1) & \ldots & \phi_{N_e}(\textrm{x}_{N})
\end{array}
\right|.
$$

This is called a **single determinant wavefunction**. It forms the basis
of many methods for approximately solving the Schrodinger equation.
