And so it begins.

That place to call home.

It has certainly taken some time. I've made an abortive attemp to do
this once before, with the Wordpress, but it didn't work. I was't
clear about what I wanted to wrote about. I didn't like the format,
the lack of control over my text.

And what _is_  going to be in here, you ask?

Ah.

I'm intending this to be technical --- about quantum chemistry and
crystallography, and the compter codes I write to support the work in
there. I'm intending it to be about what I know about: the strange
things that anything but banal. But no doubt some other things of
interest will creep in adding piquancy on top ofthe meat.

Welcome.

Enjoy your stay.
