And so it begins.

That place to call home.

Like the universe, this blog has taken time to get where it is. 

I made an abortive attempt to do this once before --- with WordPress. It didn't
work because I was't clear about what I wanted to say. Also, I didn't like the
format, the lack of control of my material. With MarkDown Iâ€™ve hit the sweet spot.

So: what _is_  going to be in here?

I want this to be mainly technical --- about quantum chemistry,
crystallography, and the computer codes I write to support that work. I want it
to be about the text books, journal articles, and conferences I go to related
to those topics. I daresay some teaching material will creep in.

I want this to be about the things I know about: the strange things that
are anything but banal.

Welcome.

Enjoy your stay.
