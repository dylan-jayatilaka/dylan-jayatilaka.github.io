And so it begins.

That place to call home.

Like the universe, this blog taken some time to get where it is. I made an
abortive attempt to do this once before --- with Wordpress. It didn't work
because I was't clear about what I wanted to say. Also, I didn't like the
format, the lack of control over my text.

So: what _is_  going to be in here, you ask?

I'm intending this to be mainly technical --- about quantum chemistry and
crystallography, the computer codes I write to support that work, the text
books, journal articles, conferences I go related to those topics. I daresay
some teaching material will creep in.

I'm intending this to be about what I know about: the strange things that
anything but banal. 

Welcome.

Enjoy your stay.
