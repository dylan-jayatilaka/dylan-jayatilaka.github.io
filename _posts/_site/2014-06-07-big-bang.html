<p>And so it begins.</p>

<p>That place to call home.</p>

<p>It has certainly taken some time. I&#8217;ve made an abortive attemp to do this once before, with the Wordpress, but it didn&#8217;t work. I was&#8217;t clear about what I wanted to wrote about. I didn&#8217;t like the format, the lack of control over my text.</p>

<p>And what <em>is</em> going to be in here, you ask?</p>

<p>Ah.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m intending this to be technical &#8212; about quantum chemistry and crystallography, and the compter codes I write to support the work in there. I&#8217;m intending it to be about what I know about: the strange things that anything but banal. But no doubt some other things of interest will creep in adding piquancy on top ofthe meat.</p>

<p>Welcome.</p>

<p>Enjoy your stay.</p>
