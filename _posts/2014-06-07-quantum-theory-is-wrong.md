I should some words about quantum mechanics to begin with as that topic
will permeate everything from now on.

Quantum mechanics is held as being inscrutable, and one of the best
theories we have. It is claimed to produce extremely precise and
accurate predictions. nd it is true! From this, it is tempting to
conclude that the story has ended. So what if it is inscrutable? Surely
this comes about from it’s mathematical complexity? Whoever said the
universe had to be simple? Isn’t it enough that it had until now been
_predictable_ (or if not, we know why not)?

I think that this claim is false.

Quatum mechanics in its standard form is fundamentally flawed.

Because of this, in certain circumstances, it cannot make predictions at
all!

## Two theories

Quantum mechanics in its standard form is actually two theories. 

1. The first part is the Schrodinger mechanics which describes the
   system as an evolving correlated many particle wave. Apart from the
   fact that a particle either has a momentum or a position, not both,
   the correspondence to classical mechanics is clear. 

2. The second part is the infamous collapse postulate which states that
   after a measurement the system discontinususly changes from one wave
   to another. The latter state-wave is by definition one of the
   normalized eigenstates of the measurement operator; and the
   probability that one obtains this state depends on the ``overlap’’ of
   the initial and final wave functions.

The second part is nonsense. How does the collapse occur? How long does
it take? What is the _phase_ of the final wave? Is that random as well?

In a later post I will explain why quantum mechanics in it’s current
form must be a statistical theory. And in any statistical theory there
is an inherent unexplained component. For example, when one takes
statistics on the heights of people in a population, the reason why
those people actually have a height to be measured is not of interest.

There is a school of thought, the *Copenhagen interpretation*, which
argues that this is _all_ we can ever know. In other words, it is
meaningless to ask what happens during the measurement-collapse event.
This interpretation goes too far. 

The problem is, the Copenhagen interpretation, when applied to doing
statistics on the heights of people, would encourage us _not_ enquire
into what height actually is. Now, perhaps in the case of the quantum
world, that may be sensible, but is is nevertheless unsatisfactory.
Besides, if it is meaningless to question what happens during a quatum
measurement event, it would also be meaningless to make assertions about
the nature of that event. But the Copenhagen school indeed makes such an
assertion --- namely that it is incognito. It is therefore a _logically_
inconsistent explanation.

Luckily much progress has been made in investigating these issues. The
theory of _quantum decoherence_ is currently very fashionable and
compelling. One of it’s champions, Zurek, writes elegantly on the topic
but for my taste, not quite convincingly. On the other hand others such
as Deutch make an equally compelling case for the ``many worlds’’
interpretation.

## Quantum chemistry

What has all this to do with quantum chemistry? 

Quite a lot, actually. 

I will give two examples.

1. There is a tendency in this field to depend very much on the
   statements made by Dirac to the effect that ``all of chemistry is now
   explained’’ by quantum mechanics. The arguments above show that this
   is clearly false. It may be the case for model systems which are
   highly decoupled from their environments. However, it is in chemistry
   where systems become large and complex, and it is in precisely these
   cases that the notions of system-separability become critical. Not
   everything can be regarded usefully as an isolated system. To give
   one example, consider the case of electrical conductivity through a
   single molecule. 

2. Second, quantum chemists often emphasis on _Hermitian operators_. The
   claim is that ``all observables must be Hermitian’’. Certainly,
   Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues, and the results of
   measurements should be real. And a Hermitian operator ensures that
   the time development of the wavefunction is unitary, leading to a
   normalized wave function for all time. However, many measurements are
   conveniently described by complex operators. For example, in the
   theory of scattering there are situations where particle probability
   is not conserved with time --- corresponding to particle absorption,
   decay, or destruction. There are other experiments in diffraction
   where it is convenient if one assumes the _phase_ as well as the
   amplitude of a wave is measured; these experiments too are
   conveniently regarded in terms of complex operators.

All this is to indicate to you to always be on guard to be skeptical
about grand statements like “everything is known’’, or “this is exact”.
Implicit in these is _always_ the model. Always.

## Einstein’s quote

At this point I should present a quite remarkable exchange between Einstein and
Heisenberg, which the latter included in his memoirs. It clearly illustrates
what I have been trying to say. But it will have to wait for another post.

## The bright side

I don’t want to give you the wrong impression.

When applied properly and appropriately, Quantum mechanics _does_
produce great results. Hence, it is well worth developing a feeling for
it. If you don’t think that is true, you should keep reading papers,
keep doing your own calculations. The best way is if you do the work
yourself, it becomes much more convincing that way. Hence this blog.

From my experience, it is really is quite astounding how the mathematics
of quantum mechanics can be used to produce the same numbers that an
experimentalist does, each of us work laboriously on seemingly quite
divergent directions.

Now my old supervisor, Handy, used to say

> Chemistry is the last field where, as the system becomes bigger, you get
> reproducible results. Any bigger and you tend to start with statistical
> mechanical approximations which have an intrinsic irreproducibility due to
> random random sampling.

If you accept this, then it follows that quantum chemistry is the last field
where concerns about separability of system and environment can be _numerically
probed_ and experimentally tested.

Is anyone actualy doing this? I don’t know. Why don’t you try?
