        <p>I should some words about quantum mechanics to begin with as that topic
will permeate everything from now on.</p>

<p>Quantum mechanics is held as being inscrutable, and one of the best
theories we have. It is claimed to produce extremely precise and
accurate predictions. And it is true! </p>

<p>From this, it is tempting to conclude that the story has ended. So what if it
is inscrutable? Surely this is just because it is mathematically complex?
Whoever said the universe had to be simple? Isn’t it enough that it is
<em>predictable</em>?</p>

<p>I think that this claim is false: the story of quantum mechanics has not ended.</p>

<p>In fact, quantum mechanics in its standard form is fundamentally flawed.
In certain circumstances, as you will see, it <em>refuses</em> to make any predictions
at all!</p>

<h2 id="two-theories">Two theories</h2>

<p>Quantum mechanics in its standard form is actually two theories. </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The first part is the Schrodinger mechanics which describes the
system as an evolving correlated many particle wave. Apart from the
fact that a particle either has a momentum or a position, not both,
the correspondence to classical mechanics is clear. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second part is the infamous postulate which states that
after a measurement the system discontinususly changes from one wave
to another. The latter wave is by definition one of the
normalized eigenstates of the measurement operator; and the
probability that one obtains this state depends on the “overlap” of
the initial and final wave functions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The second part is nonsense! </p>

<p>How does the collapse occur? How long does it take? What is the <em>phase</em> of the
final wave? Is that random as well? Standard quantum mechanics forbids us to even
ask the question!</p>

<p>In a later post I will explain why quantum mechanics in it’s current
form must be a statistical theory. And in any statistical theory there
is an inherent unexplained component. For example, when one takes
statistics on the heights of people in a population, the reason why
those people actually have a height to be measured is not of interest.
We just collect statistics. Quantum mechanics makes such statistical
predictions as you can see.</p>

<p>There is a school of thought, the <em>Copenhagen interpretation</em>, which
argues that this is <em>all</em> we can ever know. In other words, it is
meaningless to ask what happens during the measurement-collapse event.
This interpretation goes too far.</p>

<p>Here is why:</p>

<p>The problem is, the Copenhagen interpretation, when applied to doing
statistics on the heights of people, would encourage us <em>not</em> enquire
into what height actually is. How did these people <em>become</em> tall or
short? The Copenhagen interpretation says: “Sorry, I’m only allowed
to tell you the statistical result!”. Now, perhaps in the case of the quantum
world, that may be the case, but is is nevertheless unsatisfactory. </p>

<p>Besides, if it is meaningless to question what happens during a quantum
measurement event, it must also be equally meaningless to make assertions about
the nature of that event. But the Copenhagen school makes just such an
assertion! Namely: that we are not allowed to question how the collapse-event
occurs. The event is supposed to be <em>incognito</em>. Clearly then, making such
an assertion is <em>logically</em> inconsistent by it’s own standards!</p>

<p>Luckily much progress has been made in investigating these issues. The
theory of <em>quantum decoherence</em> is currently very fashionable and
compelling. One of it’s champions, Zurek, writes elegantly on the topic
but for my taste, not quite convincingly. On the other hand others such
as Deutch make an equally compelling case for the “many worlds”
interpretation.</p>

<h2 id="quantum-chemistry">Quantum chemistry</h2>

<p>What has all this to do with quantum chemistry?</p>

<p>Quite a lot, actually.</p>

<p>I will give two examples.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>There is a tendency in this field to depend very much on the
statements made by Dirac to the effect that “all of chemistry is now
explained” by quantum mechanics. The arguments above show that this
is clearly false. It may be the case for model systems which are
highly decoupled from their environments. However, it is in chemistry
where systems become large and complex, and it is in precisely these
cases that the notions of system-separability become critical. Not
everything can be regarded usefully as an isolated system. To give
one example, consider the case of electrical conductivity through a
single molecule.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, quantum chemists often emphasis on <em>Hermitian operators</em>. The
claim is that “all observables must be Hermitian”. Certainly,
Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues, and the results of
measurements should be real. And a Hermitian operator ensures that
the time development of the wavefunction is unitary, leading to a
normalized wave function for all time. However, many measurements are
conveniently described by complex operators. For example, in the
theory of scattering there are situations where particle probability
is not conserved with time — corresponding to particle absorption,
decay, or destruction. There are other experiments in diffraction
where it is convenient if one assumes the <em>phase</em> as well as the
amplitude of a wave is measured; these experiments too are
conveniently regarded in terms of complex operators.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>All this is to indicate to you: always be on guard about grand statements like
“everything is known’’, or “this is exact”. Implicit in these is <em>always</em> the
model. Always.</p>

<h2 id="einsteins-quote">Einstein’s quote</h2>

<p>At this point I should present a quite remarkable exchange between Einstein and
Heisenberg, which the latter included in his memoirs. It clearly illustrates
what I have been trying to say. But it will have to wait for another post.</p>

<h2 id="the-bright-side">The bright side</h2>

<p>I don’t want to give you the wrong impression.</p>

<p>Quantum mechanics <em>does</em> produce great results. Hence, it is well worth
developing a feeling for it. If you don’t think that is true, you should keep
reading papers, keep doing your own calculations. The best way is if you do the
work yourself, it becomes much more convincing that way. Hence this blog.</p>

<p>From my experience, it is really is quite astounding how the mathematics
of quantum mechanics can be used to produce the same numbers that an
experimentalist does: each of us works laboriously on seemingly quite
divergent directions and at the end of the day we invariably get the
same result.</p>

<p>Now my old supervisor, Handy, used to say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quantum chemistry is the last field where, as the system becomes bigger, you get
reproducible results. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this he meant that calculations on systems which are any bigger invariably
require statistical mechanical techniques, and these have an intrinsic
irreproducibility due to random random sampling.</p>

<p>If you accept this, then it follows that quantum chemistry is the last field
where concerns about separability of system and environment can be <em>numerically
probed</em> and experimentally tested. We invariably get the same result as the
experimentalist, but do we always hae to?</p>

<p>Are quantum chemists actually looking for cases where the results might differ?
I don’t know. Why don’t you try?</p>
