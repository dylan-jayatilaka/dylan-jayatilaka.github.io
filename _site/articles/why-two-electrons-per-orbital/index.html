        <p>Electron are negatively charged and repel each other.</p>

<p>How is it possible that within atoms and molecules they suddenly turn
schizophrenic and two of them occupy the same orbital?</p>

<p>Frankly, this is nuts.</p>

<p>I have never encountered a simple, vivid and correct explanation which makes
this contradiction acceptable. On the contrary, in basic chemistry, we simply
<em>assert</em> that the electrons “fill-up” the orbitals that way with “opposite spin”.
But how does tha <em>explain</em> anything? What has spin got to do with any of this?</p>

<h2 id="electrons-are-four-dimensional">Electrons are four dimensional</h2>

<p><strong>The real answer is that electrons actually inhabit their own special four
dimensional space</strong>.</p>

<p>For electrons, this fourth dimension is special: unlike the three normal
dimensions whose coordinates \( x \), \( y \) and \( z \) may take any
value in the range \(-\infty \) to \( +\infty \), the extra fourth dimension
is bound to the surface a <em>complex two dimensional circle</em>. The fourth
coordinate is actually a kind of “wrapped up” line; and like any circle
it is described by two numbers, say \( a \) and \( b \) which are
not independent but are restricted by the equation \( |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1\).
One could also think of the extra fourth dimension as comprised of
two extra sub-dimensions.</p>

<p>In a later post I will show that this extra fourth dimension is used to
describe how the wavefunction of the electron changes when it is rotated in
three dimensional space. For this reason, the extra dimension is called the
electron “spin”. Because this fourth dimension is unique to electrons, it is
often called an <em>internal degree of freedom</em>. </p>

<p>In contrast, the \( x \), \( y \) and \(z \) coordinates which are common
to all particles are <em>external degrees of freedom</em>: these coordinates arise from
<em>translating</em> the particle in space.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, every fundamental particle has its own private wrapped up “spin”
dimension attached to it – although the “size” of this dimension (two in the case
of an electron) may be different for different particles. For example, the photon
has three spin components, two of which correspond to its <em>helicity</em> which is used
to describe its polarization. In all cases the extra private wrapped-up
dimension describes how the particle behaves when it rotates, and so the extra
dimension is always called spin.</p>

<p>Personally I think the distinction between internal and external degrees of freedom
is not an important one. In either case, the particle coordinates are always used
to describe how a partucles wavefunction changes when you translate or rotate it.
It just so happens that translations are easier to describe than rotations.</p>

<p>All this is a lot to take in. It is worth reading the previous paragraphs again.
To avoid any confusion, I should say that the fourth dimension we are talking
about is <em>not</em> the time dimension; spin is a completely different <em>additional</em> dimension.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-makes-sense">Why it makes sense</h2>

<p>That electrons have their own extra fourth dimension which is not immediately
obvious except when you look at how they fill up orbitals.</p>

<p>It only <em>looks</em> like there are two electrons per orbital.</p>

<p><strong>In actual fact, each electron is in its own four dimensional *spin
orbital</strong>,.</p>

<p>A spin orbital is just a normal orbital three dimensional orbital
(wavefunction) extended into the fourth dimension.</p>

<p>This notion allows us to explain why two electrons occupy an orbital and yet
still repel each other: because of the fourth dimension, electrons can
still get close to the positively charged nucleus to which they are attracted
<em>provided they stay away from each other in the fourth dimension</em> i.e. provided
they are in different spin orbitals.</p>

<p>We represent this different location in the fourth direction by an
up- or down-arrow corresponding to the fact that they are (more or less) on
opposite side of the spin circle. But you already know about the up- and down-
arrows. The difference is, now you know what those arrows actually <em>mean</em> i.e.
you can explain that idea without destroying everything that you previously knew
about electrical charges and repulsion. That’s what meaning is: it allows you
to explain things in terms of other things which you know to be “true”.</p>

<p>So the answer to the riddle “why do electrons occupy the same orbital”
is that “they don’t”. They stay away from each other, while still maintaining
their mutually close distance to the nucleus.</p>

<p>Without invoking the extra dimension, it is very hard to reconcile why
electrons should actually occupy the same region of space.</p>

<p>And actually, the existence of these extra dimensions can be derived
from the translational and rotational symmetries present in the laws of
physics.</p>

<h2 id="antisymmetry-and-electron-spin">Antisymmetry and electron spin</h2>

<p>In a previous post we noted that the fact that particles are identical imposes
a permutational symmetry on the joint wavefunction of those identical particles.
Either the wavefunction reverses sign or it stays the same: if the former, the
particle was called <em>fermion</em> if the latter, a <em>boson</em>.</p>

<p>For fermions, the antisymmetry of the wavefunction was called the <em>Pauli principle</em>.</p>

<p>In fact, all <em>matter-like</em> particles must obey the antisymmetry principle, because
the antisymmetry principle demands particles have a zero probability of
occupying the same region of space. This is exactly as one would expect for
“solid” particles: such particle simply can’t occupy the same space at any time
(the same does not hold for bosons which have a symmetric wavefunction). In the case
of electrons, we interpret “space” to mean the four dimensional space that the
electrons <strong>really</strong> occupy.</p>

<p>I bring all of this up only to underscore the notion that electron spin as an
extra dimension is a way to reconcile how two otherwise identical electrons can
<strong>not</strong> be in the same region of 3 dimensional space and yet still be close to
a nucleus in that same three dimensional space. The extra-dimension idea is
consistent with Pauli’s antisymmetry principle.</p>

<h2 id="spin-and-antisymmetry">Spin and antisymmetry</h2>

<p>From this discussion, we see that the notion of spin (i.e  behaviour of a
wavefunction under rotations) has something to do with <em>antisymmetry</em> (i.e behaviour
of wavefunctions when you swap coordinates of identical particles).</p>

<p>In fact, Pauli received the Nobel Prize for proving that, if a particle has
a spin quantum number which is a half integer, a wavefunction involving two
of those particles must reverse sign whenever the coordinates of those
particles are swapped. This is known as the spin-statistics theorem and has to
rank as one of the deepest proerties of the universe. The proof of this theorem
is rather complicated and involves relativistic quantum mechanics and field theory.</p>

<p>In fact, I think the general view is that Pauli has not actually <em>proved</em> this
theorem but merely shown that it is <em>consistent</em> with other important
assumptions made in quantum mechanics. Ricjard Feynman was rather dissatisfied with
Pauli’s proof, and I must admit, so am I!</p>

<h2 id="a-vivid-example">A vivid example</h2>

<p>All of this is rather abstract.</p>

<p>In the hopes of making the essential idea clearer in class, I have tried the
following demonstration.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>I ask two boys to stand up in the same rows of the lecture theatre seats
near the front – where the seats are never occupied – and move towards each
other</strong>. Of course, they are unable to pass each other. These two boys are
supposed to represent two electrons of the same spin coordinate. Since they
have the same spin coordinate they cannot “pass” each other (they are trapped
between the rows).</li>
</ul>

<figure>
   <img src="/images/anders-krisar-by-christian-larsen-yatzer-2013.jpg" />
</figure>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Next I ask a boy and a girl in different but consecutive rows of
seats to move towards each other</strong>. When they are about to cross I shout out
“stop”. At this point, the rest of the students (who are clustered at the
back of the theatre) can see that the girl and the boy are roughly “on top”
of each other. They <em>look</em> as if they are occupying the same space, but are
actually on different rows. This is exactly analogous to the case of two
electrons with different spin being able to cohabit the same three dimensional
position.</li>
</ul>
