Hi there. I'm Dylan Jayatilaka.

I am a Professor and chemist working in theory, computation and
diffraction experiments at the University of Western Australia (UWA) in the
wonderfully remote city of Perth. 

I learned quantum mechanics at UWA and I am still learning it there. Along the
way I have picked up a few tricks at Cambridge in England, at NASA Ames in
Mountain View California, at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, at the
Australian National University in Canberra, and at the Universite Henri
Poincare in Nancy, and at Bern in Switzerland. A few elders have taken me under
their wing to nurture me. And more than ever, I now get a lot from you out
there through the liquid crystal of my misanthropic terminal.

Welcome.

Enjoy your visit.
